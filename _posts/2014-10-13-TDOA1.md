### Introduction

In this article we will look at signal processing techniques for time delay estimation.

### Background

Time delay estimation has been a research topic of significant practical importance in
many fields like radar, sonar, seismology, geophysics, ultrasonic's, hands-free communications,Doppler positioning systems etc and is of fundamental importance in a variety of signal-processing applications.

The problem boils down to computing the location of a digitized "signature" waveform residing within a larger time-slice.


Let $s(n)$ be the sound source signal.
Let us consider two  spatially separated sensors and $x\_{1}(t)$ and $x\_{2}(t)$ be result of propagation of $s(t)$ through different paths to reach the respective sensors.

A simple propagation model is that the signals just encounter attenuation and delay and are corrupted by additive noise

$x\_{i}(t) =  a\_{i} s(t- \tau\_{i}) + b\_{i}(t)$

where ,

$b\_{i}(t)$ is the additive noise uncorrelated with the signal

We make a assumption that the distance from the sensors to the source is very large compared to the spatial separation between the sensors.Thus signal $s(t)$ received by both the receivers is the same,there is no significant change in the signal as it travels thorough different paths to reach the spatially separated sensors.


### Cross-correlation

One of the simplest method of time delay estimation is cross-correlation .
The cross-correlation of two signals is a measure of similarity between the two sequences.
The cross-correlation function is maximized when both the signals have significant overlap.

$R\_{xy}(k) = \sum\_{i} {x(i) y(i+k)} = x[n]*y[-n]$

Compute maximum absolute value of the correlation function to estimate the lag.

To test the results we create  create two sequences,one a delayed version of another.
We add white noise to the delayed sequence and use sample correlation to detect the lag.
while performing correlation we normalize the signals,so that correlation measure is bounded
between [0,1]

Now we increase the noise to try to get estimate of noise co-variance at which this technique fails.
we run the experiment 100 times and estimate the number of times we get the proper answer.

#### Testing with Different Additive Noise Covariance

At 2 db SNR we can see the variance of estimated time delay increasing with rising noise levels.

![enter image description here]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/images/image11.png)

We can see in the auto-correlation plot the difference between the peak and its neighbors is not significant and depending on the random noise levels introduced,we may not always get the right answer.

As noise increases,we can see variance in the estimated time delay increases and error in estimation also increases.As the level of noise increases, the uncertainty in the time-delay estimate increases

We need a reliable time delay estimator in presence of additive noise.

If is always difficult to estimate the time delays for a base-band signal illustrated above.The due to the noise,we are not reliably able to estimate the delay corresponding to the maximal overlap between the noisy and ideal signal.

### Rectangular Pulse signals 

Let us look at the results for a different signal in the form of a rectangular pulse .
we will consider the wave of same duration 30.

<pre class="brush : python ">
 *********** Information ************ 
time delay :  10
Noise : 0.5

Correct  86  Incorrect  15
mean  9.92079207921 Std  1.11411438271
</pre>
we see that signal has a lower SNR,but accuracy and estimated time delay variance is lower.

![enter image description here]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/images/image12.png)
Thus the type of pulse we use has a impact on the accuracy of auto-correlation function.

<pre class="brush:python">
def rectangular(N,start,end):
        """ fuction generates a rectangular pulse 
        
        Parameters
        ---------
        N : integer
            length of signal
            
        start,end: integer
                starting and ending index of pulse
        
        """
        x = np.zeros((1,N))
        x[:,start:end]=1;
        x=x.flatten();    
        return x;
 </pre>
 
### Coded Pulses 
Broadband  techniques have a sequence of code pulses that increase the accuracy of time delay estimation in the presence of noise.

<pre class="brush : python ">
time delay :  10
Noise : 0.5
SNR 2.55272505103
Correct  95  Incorrect  6
mean  9.93069306931 Std  1.01725144864

</pre>

![enter image description here]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/images/image13.png)

<pre class="brush:python">
x=rectangular(20,8,14)+rectangular(20,2,5)
</pre>

But most of the time we do not have control of the source pulse.

In the remainder of the article we will assume that it is a rectangular pulse of duration 1000
with impulse of duration 50 starting at 100.
<pre class="brush : python ">
time delay :  10
Noise : 0.5
SNR -6.98970004336
Correct  856  Incorrect  144
mean  9.991 Std  0.561176442841
</pre>

![enter image description here]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/images/image14.png)

<pre class="brush:python">
x=rectangular(1000,100,150)
</pre>

Now given source signal,we need to see if we can do better in the presence of additive noise atleast.In real life situations there will be a host of other distortions and effects which will  increase the estimation errors apart from noise.

For pulses like the ones observed above,noise is a dominant factor,signal energy is low compared to noise energy.

### Modulated Pulses

Often the pulses are modulated by sinusoidal waves for longer range transmissions.

        x = np.zeros((1,N))
        t=np.asarray(range(0,end-start));
        x[:,start:end]=np.cos(2*np.pi*f*(t+tau)/Fs);
        
        return x.flatten();
</pre>

### Carrier Synchronization Issues 

we can synchronize exactly with the carrier ,then like broadband techniques we can achieve a significantly enhanced SNR. However synchronizations are never possible.

we introduce a phase delay of 1 sample to check the effect of carrier phase errors
<pre class="brush : python ">

</pre>

![enter image description here]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/images/image16.png)

In such cases another approach might be to use rectangular envelope
but in the present case that also does not seem to help

</pre>
#### Envelope Detection
We perform envelope detection on the signal and then apply correlation.
This improves the situation considerably

                s=abs(scipy.signal.hilbert(s))
</pre>

                
### Filtering

If we known the carrier frequency ,we can filter the noise outside the signal  bandwidth before performing the correlation operation.

For the remaining examples we consider signal with carrier frequency of 1KHz and Sampling rate
of 5Khz. The reason for that is explained below

Let us first look at the frequency characteristics of the rectangular pulse

![enter image description here]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/images/image26.png)

The sharp transition at the edges of the rectangular pulse give rise to high frequency components.
Thus while filtering we need to take these into account,else we may end up distorting the edge
leading to errors in time delay estimation.

The width of the mainlobe in frequency domain is inversely proportional to width of rectangular pulse
in the time domain.Thus a wider pulse in the time domain will provide higher spectral compression in the frequency domain.

we can see that main lobe of the rectangular pulse would have normalize freuency of 0.05
Few of the side lobes also contain significant information.

<pre class="brush:python">

def plotFrequency(b,a=1):
    """ the function plots the frequency and phase response """
    w,h = signal.freqz(b,a)
    h_dB = abs(h);#20 * np.log(abs(h))/np.log(10)
    subplot(211)
    plot(w/max(w),h_dB)
    #plt.ylim(-150, 5)
    ylabel('Magnitude (db)')
    xlabel(r'Normalized Frequency (x$\pi$rad/sample)')
    title(r'Frequency response')
    subplot(212)
    h_Phase = np.unwrap(np.arctan2(np.imag(h),np.real(h)))
    plot(w/max(w),h_Phase)
    ylabel('Phase (radians)')
    xlabel(r'Normalized Frequency (x$\pi$rad/sample)')
    title(r'Phase response')
    plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5)
</pre>    

We try with a normalized frequency components of 0.05 which contains around 3 adjacent side-lobes


![enter image description here]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/images/image31.png)

we can see that the signal has been attenuated near the edges.Thus the distortion in the region where the pulse starts will lead  to ambiguity of time delay computation.

Thus we need to consider the freuency components to retain so that sharp transition in time domain are not affected

The carrier freuency is 1Khz .The normalized carrier frequency at sampling rate of 5Khz is 0.4.
Thus the spectrum of modulated rectangular pulse is centered at 0.4

![enter image description here]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/images/image30.png)

Thus significant frequency band lies from 0.3 to 0.5.

If we bandpass filter frequencies in this band,we should get a relatively noiseless waveform,which is expected to improve the performance of correlation.

We apply band-pass  butter worth filter of order 2 with normalized cutoff frequencies are 0.2 and 0.6.

</pre>    

The butter-worth band-pass filter is not a zero phase .It will introduce different phase delay depending of frequency. The.The phase plot of the band pass filter is not linear,


To see the phase delay effects of bandpass butter-worth filter,we consider the case of no noise .
we can see that instead of 10,delay is introduced as 12 due to butter-worth filter. However we have a stable singular correlation peak being detected

To compensate for that we need to use zero phase filtering techniques like forward backward filtering.

To achieve zero phase the linear filter is applied twice, once forward and once backwards. The combined filter has zero phase.In general  forward-backward filtering squares the amplitude response and zeros the phase response if phase of filter is linear.

we see that there are few errors inspire of applying the forward backward algorithm due to distortions introduced by bandpass filtering of high frequency components.Though the mean is closer to actual delay of 10.

This tells us that we cannot eliminate the effects introduced due to filtering.

we now introduce noise and compare the performance against envelope detection.

</pre>

Compared to just envelope detection,we can see that standard deviation has reduced.Thus the neighborhood of estimated TDOA values are reduced,though the mean is shifted away from 10 may be due to the phase delay effects of bandpass filter.

Though band-pass filtering did not lead to a significant improvement  due no the noise within the frequency bandwidth .It is essential to keep out unwanted frequency components due to environmental noise and other factors.
